Arrived on site and when running water found that the drain seems to be backing up. Went downstairs to unit 2 to see if the tenant in that unit was having issues as well. Tenant in 2 said that his stuff was draining properly. Ran back upstairs moved washer and dryer and snaked laundry drain. Noticed my cable didn’t get far and figured it was on a cross. Poured a bottle of thrift down the lav drain and laundry drain. Noticed the drain was draining a little better but still seemed to be draining slow. Disconnected washer and dryer and cut a hole in the wall to try and snake the line through the vent. When cutting the vent noticed that it had seemed loose in the wall. Dropped pipe down and found that it had an studor vent on it. Went to Home Depot to grab a new studor vent and a access panel. Replaced studor vent. Ran water in laundry and sink several times and no issues were found at this time.

There is a leak in the bathroom ceiling and it's constantly leaking. It's leaking into the wall. 

Dixie Plumbing notes:
Removed tub, spout, and diverter stem and replaced tub spout, and diverter stem. Tested and there’s no leaks when tub is in use. Tested tub by turning shower on and found that when the shower is turned on, it leaks from the outside portions of the tub down into the unit below. The grout and the caulking around the tub has worn away in numerous areas. 
Would highly recommend replacing the tile around the tub. Would also recommend replacing the tub and shower valve when surround is being replaced

Unit B4 has a leak in the ceiling from unit B 12. On arrival, had to retrieve keys from office. Access unit b4 and found a drip when tub was used. Found that the diverter stem and the tub spout were leaking back and dripping down. Removed tub, spout, and diverter stem and replaced tub spout, and diverter stem. Tested and there’s no leaks when tub is in use. Tested tub by turning shower on and found that when the shower is turned on, it leaks from the outside portions of the tub down into the unit below. The grout and the caulking around the tub has worn away in numerous areas. Would highly recommend replacing the tile around the tub. Would also recommend replacing the tub and shower valve when surround is being replaced. Informed tenant in unit.B4 of findings. LREI needs to inform tenant in unit B 12 to not use the shower.

I was either at work or school constantly for months and needed to make sure I could be here because of my dog. I am hoping that these are mostly easy fixes. Some of these are obviously more important than others.

The light started flickering then going out at first but would still work. Eventually totally stopped. I have changed the lightbulb and that didn't fix the problem but theres a small chance that bulb didn't work either.

A swarm of ants showed up in the beginning of April. Despite having baits out it only kept increasing in the first two weeks. I have tried 3 different brands and 4 different types of poison and although they are a lot more under control, it's concerning that they are still here nearly 2 months later. I am trying to keep them in the same place (particular kitchen counter) and I think I know where the nest is but can not get to it. I also found what looked like a roach egg casing on the bathroom floor which I am confused by because I haven't seen roaches but it's also concerning.

Two outlets on the same wall (kitchen sink) stopped working at exactly the same time. I tried to reset them and that didn't work but I don't know anything about the breaker box. The one outlet on opposite kitchen wall does work.

The water pressure dropped while I was using the sink. Using both hot and cold at the same time doesn't add much water. This isn't imperative that it be fixed but if it were something simple it would be nice.","Overhead light in bedroom, pests, outlets in kitchen, bathroom sink water pressure,",Completed,T6R86JN,06/06/2023 18:03,,06/07/2023 11:00,,,,,,,,,Mike Guelda,,,06/07/2023 11:00,https://app.propertymeld.com/1912/m/1912/meld/5431886/summary/,,

Allegedly one of the cars at the tenants house ran into the front of my home (front left portion of home near driveway). My other neighbor George confirmed what Chris said and both said the tenants' rate of speed up and down the driveway resulted in them scrapping the steep driveway. Typically, when we would go up or down the driveway, we would drive slowly mainly to avoid pedestrians who maybe walking/running and also to avoid scraping the driveway. I am telling you about both incidences in the event you hear about any property damage to the front of my house or damage to my driveway you are aware that both of these issues aren't a result of me, my family, or anyone living in the home prior to the tenant but a direct result of their actions while living/driving on my property. I do not know how you typically handle these matters, but I wanted to address what both neighbors said.

Cleaned out around the cleanout and ran funnel head with 2 cables. Got the third cable and it kept binding up. Switched out heads to a smaller funnel and couldn’t get the cables to run towards the building. Switched out head to the small spear head and ran 3 cables and water level dropped. Pulled back wipes and tampons. Once the cables were out, I saw a 2 foot stick that was stuck in the cleanout. I got the stick out. Water was not moving. So I attached the larger spear head and ran 3 cables back and forth. Water started to drain slowly. I put on a fourth cable and went a little bit further and I saw what appeared to be a larger wad of wipes and water immediately began to flow much quicker. I pulled out all the cables and water was draining good. I went inside unit 1 and ran kitchen sink, bathroom sink, and flushed approximately 15 times. Went outside and clean water was flowing through just fine. Flushed about 10 more times and checked the cleanout again and everything was flowing fine. I put in a 4 in cap on cleanout to prevent sticks and other miscellaneous debris from getting inside the cleanout.

I went to apt 17 and found that the kitchen sink drain was backed up. I pulled the trap and ran the cable machine through multiple times and pulled back sludge and grease. Then I ran my cable machine though again and pulled back mud around 20ft. I ran the cable machine though again and hit a dead stop everytime at that spot. I got the k50 and ran it though the drain line and it hung up at the same spot and I was having trouble pulling back my cable.

If you had sent someone the first time I requested help with the doors...over a year ago...you would know this already. But your reply was ""They are vintage doors. Nothing we can do."" Not true.

I noticed that the exterior basement door was ajar the other day (downstairs tenant access) and since there is no tenant I went to shut it. I'm guessing the lock was removed when the tenant was evicted, and it has not been replaced so the door cannot be secured. This means the building is not secure...please send someone ASAP.

When I investigated the basement door, I discovered a flooded and backed up sink in the neighboring basement. It smells and is really gross. It can be accessed from the exterior basement door in the back yard.

The back yard has not been cleared of leaves/debris since the fall. The sidewalk between the garages needs to be raked and cleared of leaves, mud and sticks so no one trips and falls there. There is also still trash in the yard from the first floor tenant who was evicted.

We went to the basement and cut out the old water heater, and replaced it with a new 40g gas water heater short. We put the water together and put the gas and vent together. we had to wait a little bit for the water company to fix their water line. We turned on the water and no leaks. Next we turned on the gas and everything is working properly and no leaks. We cleaned up.

Found kitchen sink clogging up after running water for about 30 seconds. I ran snake down kitchen sink drain and cleared stoppage. I reassembled p trap and ran water for 5 minutes sink was flowing also filled up basins and dumped water with no issues. Tenant also said toilet was clogged awhile back but is now OK but has occasionally heard gurgling coming from toilets. I flushed both toilets multiple times with all the water running inside of home and could not get toilets to back up or gurgle. I checked clean out in back of home and did notice it was holding a good amount of water. I ran k50 down clean out and did not pull anything back, but water did drop and is not holding as much water as it was but flowing with no issues.
I recommend running camera to see if line is flat or if there is another issue causing line to hold.",,,,,,,,Dixie Plumbing,,02/27/2023 16:28,02/28/2023 10:00,https://app.propertymeld.com/1912/m/1912/meld/4926379/summary/,,

Leaking from unit 4 bathtub into unit 2 bathroom. Ceiling is falling in. On arrival, inspected unit 2. Found prior water damage from a leak a while back. Tenant stated there was a large leak when the tub overflowed years ago. Tenant has plastic tacked up to keep the water from dripping. Went into unit 4 and ran the shower and went into unit 2 bathroom. Removed a portion of broken dry wall to expose upstairs tub area. Found that water was dripping from the top back side of the tub where the surround for the tub is. Seems like the leak is from poor caulking and broken surround. Used some caulk and caulked exposed areas that might be causing the leak. Told upstairs tenant about fix and to not use shower for at least 5 hours to allow caulking to set. Informed downstairs tenant of fix and cleaned work area. Placed plastic back on ceiling. There is severe drywall damage. There is need some some serious renovation for the restrooms up and down stairs.",,,,,,,,Dixie Plumbing,,02/14/2023 08:25,02/15/2023 08:00,https://app.propertymeld.com/1912/m/1912/meld/4862020/summary/,,

Next we used the jackhammer and beat out a hole next to the tub and found that there was 6 water lines in the way. We went and remove the tile and remove the tub. We cut the trap and remove the broken cable. Next we went to apt 3 and cut a hole next to the tub and found a vent and we ran the cable machine though and pulled back hair. We ran lots of hot water and everything is draining properly. Next we reset the tub in apt 4 and replace the waste and overflow and a new trap. We put a Repair flange down for the toilet and concrete the tub and ran lots of water and everything is working properly. Clean up and they just have to reset the toilet.

Flushed toilets and ran tub to see if there was any issues with the sewer backing up but no issues were found. Went next door to unit A3 and asked to come in to see if they were having any issues. The ceiling in their unit was water damaged and moldy.

Went upstairs to unit A11 and asked tenant if I could come in and check out his bathroom due to water leaking all the way downstairs. He said no really loudly and then yelled move while jumping at me acting like he was going to hit me if I didnt leave him alone.

Locked up unit A4 and while doing so the tenant from A11 was yelling random stuff. Seems to have been very under the influence.

02/01

Knocked on windows for unit 1 & 2 to have someone let me in the front door. Unit 1 was home and let me in. Sinks were completely backed up and over flowing onto the floor in both unit 1 & 2 according to tenant.

There was a vent cover on a hall way door and the tenant in unit 1 said that, that is where the last person that tried to clear the drain. Since there was no way to get in I removed the vent cover to allow me to crawl through the door and find a clean out under stairs. Snaked it several times with sink machine and hit dirt 4 in.

02/02

Met with LREI and Mike to go over what was going on and show them what cabinets needed pulled. Disconnected plumbing to both kitchen sinks in unit 1 &2, removed cabinets and started Jack hammering in unit 2 to find the drain line.

Found drain line for unit 2 but didnt see where unit 1 tied in just yet. Ricky arrived to help and him and Justin stayed in unit 2 continuing to dig and Jack hammer to expose pipe in unit 2 better while Jorge started Jack hammering in unit 1. Got to a point to where we saw the drain line for unit 1 ran into a Y somewhere into unit 2.

Removed more of the vinyl flooring and Jack hammered further back to see how bad the pipe was and the cast iron drain line for unit 1 was rotted out at the bottom and full of grease.

Continued Jack hammering to get us close to where the main drains tied into each other. Got to a point to where we found a spot where previous repairs were made and found pvc to tie onto. Made repairs and ran new drain lines for both units.

02/03

Ricky and Evan came back to finish back filling and finish tying in the kitchen sink drain lines to our new connections. Concrete was poured back and cleaned up area in which work was performed.

Ran camera to inspect the line and there were parts that still had grease build up on the top of the main drain line.

Will have to schedule a time to jet the line to help clear out more of the grease.",,,,,Newly Onboarded,,,Dixie Plumbing,,02/01/2023 11:52,02/01/2023 12:30,https://app.propertymeld.com/1912/m/1912/meld/4802185/summary/,,

This was bad business in my book. I work with vendors all day, and our customer needing attention, would never have been traeated like this. I had to get  boistrous on Monday, to get this fixed. We had no heat, nor hot water, and we were very upset. But, I did get my problems fixed on Monday, by your maintenance tech, MIKE, who really seemed to care, ans was able to get the parts to repair it. I still need the holes on the back roof repaired, so the ""critters"" can not get in again.
